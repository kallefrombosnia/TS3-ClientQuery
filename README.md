# TS3 Client Query

Telnet access to ts3 client query plugin.
This is project is not finished to wrap all client commands, but its allways possible to create own functions.
Current code creates connection, execute commands and get data.
Code is highly inspired by [ts3admin.class](https://github.com/par0noid/ts3admin.class) and [TeamspeakClientQueryAPI](https://github.com/FlorianSteenbuck/TeamspeakClientQueryAPI)

Feel free to submit issues/pull request if you'd like to contribute.

I wont work anymore on this, it was just testing but someone can find it useful.
Tried to make async event handler and failed, and TS5 beta came out so I dont have enough time to finish this.

Use at own risk. Didnt tested in production!
